# Task 1

## The problem that the software is solving

This software is intended to automate the process of controlling air traffic at any given airport. It will allow air traffic controllers to easily determine when the airport can accept additional planes, and make space as needed.

## Benefits

- It will allow air traffic controllers to easily see the amount of planes at the airport at a given time, and its total capacity.
- Flight times can be scheduled according to when space is needed at the airport.

## Risks

- Air traffic controllers need up-to-date, accurate information on the state of the airport to be able to safely direct planes, so not having this software could impact flight safety
